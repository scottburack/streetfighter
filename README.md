# Street Fighter

This is a basic imitation of the famous video game Street Fighter using Ruby on Rails, HTML, and custom CSS.

Users can sign up to create their player, choose a character to play with and choose an enemy to fight. Wins and losses are kept track of on the user profile page and the High Scores page.

Users are also able to message other users. Next feature we will integrate is notification when a user has a new message.
